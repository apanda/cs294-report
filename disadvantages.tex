\section{Disadvantages}
The primary disadvantage of most of this work is that it is not clear which of the failure detectors can be implemented
in practice. For instance, for any environment where all but one process can fail, all processes trusted by $\Sigma$
must include the process that does not fail. This can be a pretty strong requirement to meet, and it is not clear how
one meets this requirement in practice. 

Similarly the $\mathcal{FS}$ failure detector requires that a process never be wrongly suspected (since transitions from
$RED$ to $GREEN$ are not permitted). In this case, since some of the original motivation for this work was based on
practicality, it seems unclear that one could actually use the results in a practical manner.
