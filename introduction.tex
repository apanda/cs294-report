\section{Introduction}
The FLP result~\cite{fischer1985impossibility} showed the impossibility of achieving consensus in an asynchronous
distributed system in the presence of even one failed process. Chandra, Hadzilacos and
Toueg~\cite{chandra1996unreliable, chandra1996weakest} in a set of seminal papers showed that this impossibility could
be circumvented using failure detectors, and furthermore that the leader failure detectore ($\Omega$) is the
weakest failure detector required for solving consensus in a distributed system where a majority of processes are
correct. In ``The Weakest Failure Detectors to Solve Certain Fundamental Problems in Distributed
Computing''~\cite{delporte2004weakest}, Delport-Gallet et al
